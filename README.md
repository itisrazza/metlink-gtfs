# Metlink GTFS

This repository contains the Metlink GTFS data from their website, alongside the hash of the ZIP file and the date when the data last got updated.

This is the `data` branch, where the data resides (it's also the default branch for easy inclusion in project source code). The scripts and configuration files reside in the `scripts` branch.

I still haven't decided how often this data should update. General information about this project is on [the project website](https://github.thegreatrazz.nz/metlink-gtfs).
