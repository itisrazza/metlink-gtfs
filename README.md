# Metlink GTFS

These scripts download and publish [Metlink's Transit Information](https://www.metlink.org.nz/customer-services/general-transit-file-specification/)
onto GitHub for them to be easily included and reference from projects using
Git (via submodules).

NB: **Metlink** refers to the public transportation network covering Greater
Wellington, not Melbourne.
